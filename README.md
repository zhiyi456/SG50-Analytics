# SG50 Data Analytics Project

## About the Project
This project involved collaboration with Ray of Hope, a non-profit organization focused on providing financial assistance to individuals in need. The client have requested us to derive insights from their dataset and provide recommendations for their future campaigns.

## Project Methodology
The methodology of the study was devised in collaboration with our client, ROH. They provided us with comprehensive data encompassing various aspects of their campaigns, including campaign category, 
campaign link, target funds, duration of assistance, funds raised, funds disbursed to beneficiaries, percentage raised, and campaign years.

## Data Preprocessing
Upon receiving the data, it was evident that data cleaning and preprocessing were essential due to numerous missing values, particularly in columns such as campaign target and funds raised. 
We engaged in extensive communication with ROH to understand the reasons behind these gaps. Subsequently, we devised strategies to address the missing values, including removing certain rows with missing targets and imputing missing values in funds raised based on data from the funds disbursed column, vice versa. 
Additionally, we standardized monetary values by removing commas from the dataset.
